# Kinesis Firehose JSON to CSV

An AWS Lambda function to convert Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to a CSV file to upload to Amazon S3. It addresses the "web clickstream data" use case, for developers or companies that need to implement a clickstream to collect data to train a Machine Learning model based on user behavior.

[Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/) uses the CSV file generated by the AWS Lambda function to train the `User-item interaction` dataset.
